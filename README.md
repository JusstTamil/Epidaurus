# Epidaurus
In today's world, many people are denied access to medical amenities. In remote regions people don't have access to a good medical centre. Having good and trained doctors in those medical centres is also not guaranteed. In those places, having a computer program to atleast diagnose a patient is a boon. That is where we are headed. Basic Medical diagnosis to everyone.

## How are we going to achieve it?
Well the answer is easy. Create a mechanism that takes in the symptoms felt by the patients and run a search through the database. Return the most related results. But as any task, it is easier said than done. But this is the V8 of Epidaurus.

## What is Epidaurus?
Epuidaurus is the city of health. What is it doing on github?
Well we are here to help remote patients by bringing, if not medical care, a diagonsing tool so that they can be aware of their medical conition.
But don't get too excited yet. Epidaurus is still a *work in progress*. We are leveraing the power of medical repositories and trying to make Epidaurus perfect.
Join us on this journey and lets help the world t become better place.

## If not ready, then what is this repo?
This repository contain a basic example of how Epidaurus will work. As we said, Epidaurus is not perfect yet, so the diagnosis given by the app is not to be trusted.
With this as our solid basement we can build our service on top of it.

## What does this version of Epidaurus do?
This version of Epidaurus has a disease-finding mechanism which can find the most relevant disease from the given symptoms. But as we said earlier both the data stored and the mechanism are not perfect and we are on the journey to make it perfect.
This version also has a BMI claculator and a basic diet drafter for every age group.

## How will be the next version of Epidaurus?
The next version of Epidaurus will have a mechanism which will leverage data from a database developed and maintained by renowned institutions. We make it an API which developers can use in their projects.
